## üéÆ **Integration Flow**

### 1. Entry Fee Flow
```
1. Player initiates 0.025 0G transaction to treasury address
2. Frontend gets transaction hash
3. Frontend calls POST /verify-payment with tx details
4. Backend verifies transaction on 0G blockchain
5. If valid, player is added to game round
```

### 2. Prize Payout Flow
```
1. Game round completes with winner
2. Backend calculates prize (total pool - 5% house fee)
3. Backend calls treasury service to send payout
4. Hot wallet automatically sends 0G to winner
5. Transaction is recorded in database
```

### 3. Balance Check Flow
```
1. Frontend calls GET /balance/:address
2. Real-time balance fetched from 0G Network
3. Displayed to player before joining game
```
