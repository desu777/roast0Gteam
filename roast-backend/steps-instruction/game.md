# Game Module - Implementation Status

## ✅ COMPLETED (100%)

### 1. Core Game Service (`game.service.js` - 549 lines)
**Round Lifecycle Management:**
- ✅ `createNewRound()` - Creates new round with random character selection
- ✅ `joinRound()` - Player joins with roast submission, auto-starts at 2 players
- ✅ `startRound()` - Transitions from WAITING → ACTIVE with 120s timer
- ✅ `transitionToJudging()` - ACTIVE → JUDGING phase (15s)
- ✅ `completeRound()` - JUDGING → COMPLETED with winner selection and prizes

**Timer System:**
- ✅ Map-based timer storage (`activeTimers`)
- ✅ WebSocket updates every 1 second
- ✅ 30-second warning emissions
- ✅ Smart recovery on server restart (calculates elapsed time from DB)
- ✅ Auto-round scheduling (30s delay between rounds)

**Features:**
- ✅ Random character selection per round
- ✅ 2-player minimum with auto-start
- ✅ Prize pool calculation (95% winner, 5% house fee)
- ✅ WebSocket integration (dependency injection ready)
- ✅ Memory cleanup and graceful shutdown
- ✅ TEST_ENV logging integration

### 2. REST API Controller (`game.controller.js` - 481 lines)
**Public Endpoints:**
- ✅ `GET /api/game/current` - Current active round
- ✅ `GET /api/game/rounds` - Recent rounds with pagination
- ✅ `GET /api/game/rounds/:id` - Specific round details
- ✅ `GET /api/game/rounds/:id/submissions` - Round submissions
- ✅ `GET /api/game/stats` - Global game statistics
- ✅ `POST /api/game/join` - Join round with roast submission
- ✅ `GET /api/game/health` - Service health check

**Admin Endpoints:**
- ✅ `POST /api/game/rounds` - Force create new round
- ✅ `POST /api/game/rounds/:id/complete` - Force complete round

**Features:**
- ✅ Admin permission validation (`x-admin-address` header)
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Pagination support
- ✅ Full text access control (completed rounds only)

### 3. Express Router (`game.routes.js` - 91 lines)
- ✅ Route definitions and middleware
- ✅ Request logging for TEST_ENV
- ✅ Error handling middleware

### 4. Module Integration (`index.js` + `server.js`)
- ✅ Module exports structure
- ✅ Server integration with route mounting
- ✅ Graceful shutdown with cleanup
- ✅ Game service initialization

## 🎮 CURRENT GAME FLOW STATUS

```
WAITING → ACTIVE (120s) → JUDGING (15s) → COMPLETED → auto-restart (30s)
   ✅        ✅             ✅             ✅            ✅
```

**Game Mechanics:**
- ✅ Entry fee: 0.025 0G (from config)
- ✅ Random character selection from 6 AI judges
- ✅ 2-player minimum, auto-start
- ✅ Timer warnings and transitions
- ✅ Random winner selection (placeholder for AI evaluation)
- ✅ Server restart recovery

## 📊 TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS

- **Architecture:** Clean service/controller/routes separation
- **Performance:** Non-persistent timers with smart recovery
- **Scalability:** WebSocket emitter dependency injection ready
- **Security:** Admin permissions, input validation
- **Logging:** Comprehensive game events and TEST_ENV support
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation and recovery
- **Memory Management:** Timer cleanup and graceful shutdown

## 🔄 NEXT STEPS

### Priority 1: WebSocket Module
- Implement WebSocket service for real-time updates
- Connect to Game Module (wsEmitter injection)
- Real-time timer updates and phase transitions

### Priority 2: Treasury Module  
- Payment validation for round joining
- Prize distribution to winners
- 0G blockchain integration

### Priority 3: AI Module
- Replace random winner with AI evaluation
- Character-specific judging criteria
- Integration with configured AI service

### Priority 4: Players Module
- Player statistics and history
- Leaderboards and rankings
- Player authentication

## 🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
